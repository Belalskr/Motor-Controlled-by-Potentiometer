Embedded System Project that is a DC MOTOR Controlled by potentiometer using AVR microcontroller ATmega16 and C programming and Proteus simulation

This project has been implemented Using ATmega16 mircocontroller. It is written in C language using Eclipse IDE it is simulated using proteus Simulation

When you change the potentiometer value , the DC-motor speed changes..

when you push thebutton , external interrupt is activated and the DC MOTOR reverse its direction.

multiple AVR modules are used such as external interrupts and ADC
